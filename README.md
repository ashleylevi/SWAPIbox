# **SWAPI-BOX**



*SWAPI-BOX* is a web based application built in React that uses asynchronous fetch calls to a Star Wars API. Character, planet, people and vehicle data is then cleaned and organized into a fun UI with reusable React components. Users can browse throught these various categories and bookmark their favorite cards. Router is implemented for page navigation.

### Project Goals: 
* Asynchronously call and clean data ONLY when the user requests it.
* Separate application logic into small, testable functions.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Implement React-Router for natural page navigation.
* Create a well thought-out UI.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
